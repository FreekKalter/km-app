#Km-app

Everything needed to deploy the km webapp to my cores cluster.
It contains all the frontedn code, and other static stuff. Which will be served by nginx.
Dockerfiles for every piece of the puzzle.

The go code for the webapp itself is at [km](http://github.com/FreekKalter/km)

Postgres db -> webapp -> nginx
